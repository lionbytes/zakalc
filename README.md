# Zakalc
Zakat is the Islamic annual charity. This is a simple Zakat  calculator, built with Bootstrap 4 and vanilla JavaScript. This REPL-like Zakat calculator is designed to only aid you in calculating the Zakat of your liquid assets, and is not in any way, shape, or form a professional Zakat calculation application.
