# Zakalc
Zakat is the Islamic annual charity. This is a simple Zakat  calculator, built with Bootstrap 4 and vanilla JavaScript. This REPL-like Zakat calculator is designed to only aid you in calculating the Zakat of your liquid assets, and is not in any way, shape, or form a professional Zakat calculation application.

### TODO
- Refactor HTML code
- Refactor JavaScript code if needed
- Export data to JSON under year number
- Import data from JSON under year number
- Share on social media

### TODO: 2nd Cycle
- Turn currency select items into text inputs
- Refactoring: List all JS DOM varialbes inside one object that is created on DOM Ready (i.e. forms, constant inputs);
- Instead of JS prompts, use modal box to create and delete Savings field?
- Get calculated data on form change instead of clicking submit
- Get all currency and metal rates data from an accurate online API. 
  This way, the user can immediately start listing their fund sources each in its own currency, 
  then values of all entered the fund sources will be looked up in the API and be converted and 
  unified into one currency chosen by the user at the beginning of the process.
- Then, enable the user to enter custom prices for currencies with inaccurate rates.
- Add email reminder feature that sends emails every year to the user reminding them of paying Zakat.
